In 1976
Day & Nite was founded when brothers Kenneth and Irwin Sher honed their refrigeration skills and wanted to provide better service to customers.

In 1979
Yankee Stadium & Javits Center contracted Day & Nite for all of their cold installations. These two jobs solidified the company’s reputation to handle large projects on-time and on-budget in the New York area.

In 1980
Ken and Irwin acquired All Service in the late 1980’s and repurposed it into a commercial cooking equipment service company in the early 90’s. All Service, now almost 20 years later, shares the same distinguished reputation in the foodservice equipment service world as Day & Nite. Thus, reflecting the Day & Nite family brand of company’s staying power and depth of expertise.

In 2007
